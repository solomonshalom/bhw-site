# Here's how to make your machine the <Amount amount="best" /> it can be!

It's very important to configure your machine properly for an efficient and smooth coding experience. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get your development environment ready with VS Code and Git.

## Configuring VS Code

1. **Download and Install VS Code:**
   - Go to the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the installer for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your OS.

2. **Install Essential Extensions:**
   - Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for and install the following extensions:
     - **Prettier - Code formatter:** Helps in maintaining consistent code style.
     - **ESLint:** Integrates ESLint into VS Code to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.
     - **Live Server:** Launch a development local server with live reload feature for static and dynamic pages.
     - **GitLens:** Supercharges the built-in Git capabilities in VS Code.
     - **Python (if you're using Python):** Provides support for Python development including linting, debugging, and more.

3. **Configure User Settings:**
   - Go to File > Preferences > Settings or press `Ctrl+,`.
   - Search for and configure the following settings:
     - **Editor: Format On Save:** Enables automatic code formatting when you save a file.
     - **Editor: Tab Size:** Set the number of spaces per tab (commonly 2 or 4 spaces).

4. **Setup Integrated Terminal:**
   - VS Code comes with an integrated terminal. You can access it via View > Terminal or pressing ``Ctrl+` ``.
   - Configure your default shell (e.g., Bash, PowerShell) in the terminal settings.

## Configuring Git

1. **Install Git:**
   - Download Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. **Set Up Git in VS Code:**
   - Open VS Code and ensure Git is installed correctly by opening the terminal (`Ctrl+` `) and typing `git --version`.
   - Configure your Git identity by running the following commands in the terminal:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```

3. **Initialize a Git Repository:**
   - Open your project folder in VS Code.
   - Initialize a new Git repository by opening the terminal and running:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

4. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Stage your changes by running:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

5. **Connect to a Remote Repository:**
   - If you’re using GitHub, create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Connect your local repository to the remote repository by running:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
     ```
   - Push your changes to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, your machine will be well-configured for a productive hackathon experience. Remember to keep your tools updated and explore additional extensions and settings that can further enhance your development workflow.

Go forth and create amazing projects during the hackathon!
